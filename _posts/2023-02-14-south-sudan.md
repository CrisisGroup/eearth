South Sudan, reeling from its recent civil war, where four consecutive years of historic flooding have exacerbated food and livelihood insecurity. Rising waters have sent pastoralists fleeing south, where their presence has increased tensions and contributed to violence in the Equatoria region. According to forecasts, the country needs to brace for additonal floods in the coming months.

## Recommendations

External partners and the UN should work with South Sudanese authorities, religious leaders, community elders and others to de-escalate tensions and create security for both displaced and host communities, while protecting the needs of both.

Authorities should try to ease political tensions between the displaced and host communities, such as by organising a conference of Jonglei and Equatorian leaders to agree on basic modalities in the likely event of future displacement, including potential migration corridors, grazing land, timetables for returns, protections for farmers and host communities, and adjudication mechanisms. Though this dialogue will be contentious given the heated politics, the alternative is worsening violence as climate-driven risk factors continue to increase tensions. External partners can support such processes or fill in gaps should the authorities not take up the task."
